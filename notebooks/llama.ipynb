The electron cloud is divided into shells or orbitals, and each shell can hold a certain number of electrons. The number of electrons in the outermost shell, called the valence shell, determines the chemical properties of the atom. \\n\\nIn a neutral atom, the number of protons in the nucleus is equal to the number of electrons in the electron cloud, so the positive and negative charges balance out and the atom has no overall charge.

      "Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck were two of the most celebrated American novelists of the 20th century. Despite sharing similarities such as winning Nobel Prizes in Literature and writing about profound themes, their styles, perspectives and techniques were quite different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hemingway’s writing is characterized by a minimalist style, often described as the iceberg technique - what lies below the surface is just as, if not more, important than what is explicitly stated. His use of dialogue is reserved and powerful, with short, simple sentences that convey the characters’ emotions in an impactful way. Hemingway’s works often center on themes of war, love, loss, and courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, Steinbeck’s writing is descriptive, with vivid imagery and language that brings his characters and settings to life. Steinbeck often focused on social and economic issues, with themes of poverty, injustice, and the struggles of the working class. Steinbeck’s narratives often highlight the plight of the downtrodden and the outcast, with a sense of compassion and empathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a personal level, Hemingway was known for his adventurous lifestyle, with war reporting and big-game hunting among his pursuits. On the other hand, Steinbeck was known for his commitments to social causes, particularly civil rights and workers' rights. These personal beliefs and lifestyles are reflected in their writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Hemingway and Steinbeck made significant contributions to American literature with their unique styles and powerful thematic explorations. Their works, while distinct, continue to be widely read and admired today.</s><|endoftext|>Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Other factors, which may influence stock prices such as trading volume, earnings releases, and market news should also be included.\n",

      "\n",
      "4) Train the model: The model is trained on the historical data by inputting the features (stock prices, trading volume and other factors) and outputting the predicted stock prices. The model learns by adjusting its parameters to minimize errors between predicted and actual prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Test the model: Once the model is trained, it should be tested to evaluate its accuracy. This is done by inputting data that was not used in the training phase and comparing the predicted results with the actual results.\n",
