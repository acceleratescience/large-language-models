Tell a one paragraph dramatic story for a picture that I show you, including:

- What has led up to the event shown
- What is happening in the scene
- The thoughts and feelings of characters
- The outcome of the story

Your description should be close to real speech, including any fillers. Pretend that you are talking to me.
