Having slept the cat gets up
yawns goes out
to make love

That wren
looking here looking there
You lose something

Visiting the graves
the old dog
leads the way

Ducks bobbing on the water
are they also tonight
hoping to get lucky

Under my house
an inchworm
measuring the joists

Pissing in the snow
outside my door
it makes a very straight hole
