Dawn's first light
a spider weaves anew
its dew-kissed web

Winter stillness
a lone crow's caw echoes
through barren trees

Gentle stream flows
a leaf rides the current
to unknown shores

Summer heat shimmers
cicadas' song rises
from parched earth

Moonlit garden
shadows of peonies
dance with the breeze

Autumn rain patters
on the old temple roof
monks chant within

Cherry blossoms fall
a child's laughter carries
on spring winds

Morning frost gleams
on bamboo leaves
sun slowly climbs

Fireflies blink
in the summer twilight
stars come alive

Mountain snowmelt
a clear stream rushes past
awakening ferns

Old scarecrow stands
tattered hat askew
crows laugh nearby

Harvest moon rises
over golden rice fields
farmer's weary smile

Withered grass bends
beneath winter's first snow
time's gentle touch

Dragonfly hovers
above still pond waters
ripples of blue sky

Autumn wind whispers
through red maple leaves
a story untold

Frog's eyes reflect
the vast starry sky
universe in a pond

Spring rain taps softly
on closed plum blossoms
patient awakening

Evening settles in
cat curled by the hearth
shadows lengthen
