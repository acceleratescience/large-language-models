Silent autumn night,
A frog leaps into the pond—
Sound of water's splash.

Winter's icy breath,
Lonely crow on a bare branch—
Stillness in the air.

First light on dew fields,
A single blossom opens—
Morning's gentle sigh.

Waves kiss the shore's edge,
Moonlight dances on the sea—
Eternal embrace.

Ancient pine whispers,
Wind carries old tales away—
Stars listen in peace.
