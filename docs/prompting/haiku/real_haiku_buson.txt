Even more so
because of being alone
the moon is a friend

The winter storm
The voice of the rushing water
Torn by the rocks

The first snow falls
then it melts
into dew on the grass

The first snow
Sounding it out
The moon over the bamboos

Still lonelier
Than last year
Autumn evening

In the human world
the gourd has found
a place for itself
