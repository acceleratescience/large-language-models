# Prompting

In this section we cover two main areas:

1. Prompt engineering techniques such as chain of thought (CoT), and few-shot learning'
2. Building prompt templates with Jinja

We then run through an exercise on how to extract topics out of real Nature article abstracts, and how to generate fake Nature abstracts using `gpt-4o-mini`. Finally, we look at how we might be able to tell the difference between real and fake writing.
