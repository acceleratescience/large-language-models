Acharya, S. K. Bose, E. Galli, S. A. Brown*\\nCurrent efforts to achieve neuromorphic computation are focused on highly organized architectures, such as\\nintegrated circuits and regular arrays of memristors, which lack the complex interconnectivity of the brain and\\nso are unable to exhibit brain-like dynamics. New architectures are required, both to emulate the complexity of\\nthe brain and to achieve critical dynamics and consequent maximal computational performance. We show here\\nthat electrical signals from self-organized networks of nanoparticles exhibit brain-like spatiotemporal correla-\\ntions and criticality when fabricated at a percolating phase transition. Specifically, the sizes and durations of\\navalanches of switching events are power law distributed, and the power law exponents satisfy rigorous criteria\\nfor criticality. These signals are therefore qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those measured in the cortex.\\nOur self-organized networks provide a low-cost platform for computational approaches that rely on spatio-\\ntemporal correlations, such as reservoir computing, and are an important step toward creating neuromorphic\\ndevice architectures.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThere is currently huge interest in building neuromorphic computa-\\ntional systems that operate on brain-like principles to perform cer-\\ntain tasks (e.g., classification and pattern recognition) much more\\nefficiently than on traditional computers. Neuromorphic processing\\nhas been implemented in a number of hardware platforms, using\\ncomponents ranging from traditional silicon-based technology (1, 2),\\ncrossbar memristor arrays (3–6), and novel nanoscale device elements\\nthat use atomic-scale dynamics to mimic the behavior of synapses and\\nneurons (7–9). All of these approaches rely on highly ordered architec-\\ntures, but neuromorphic computational paradigms such as reservoir\\ncomputing (RC) (10–12) require complex networks with strong in-\\nherent spatiotemporal correlations (13, 14). Maximal computational\\nperformance (15–17) in these systems requires network architec-\\ntures that are not only complex but also critical (18).\\nAt a critical point (17–20), the underlying network is scale free\\n(21, 22), and the dynamics are characterized by scale-invariant ava-\\nlanches, as observed in many systems ranging from earthquakes to\\nbiological extinctions and magnetization dynamics (23). Put simply,\\na critical system is poised such that any event is likely to trigger sub-\\nsequent events, leading to a cascade (15).

The two-dimensional percolating\\nsystem of interest here comprises conducting nanoparticles deposited\\non an insulating substrate (29) (Fig. 1A). During deposition (see\\nMaterials and Methods), particles come into contact and form groups\\nthat are separated from each other by tunnel gaps. The groups increase\\nin size and complexity as more particles are deposited until the onset\\nof conduction across the system (Fig. 1, B and D) when the fraction of\\nthe surface that is covered with conducting elements is pc ~68% (28–31).\\nThis onset marks the percolation threshold, which is a critical point be-\\ntween insulating and conducting phases (28) at which avalanches might\\nbe expected to propagate (17) (see next paragraph). We hypothesized\\nthat when poised at this phase transition, the percolating assembly of\\nnanoparticles might be promising for neuromorphic computing since\\n(i) the correlation length diverges (28) and so long-range correlations\\nare expected; (ii) it has previously been established that synapse-like\\natomic-scale switching processes occur in the tunnel gaps (29); (iii) de-\\nvices are stable over periods of months (32) as required for real-world\\napplications; and (iv) the complex networks are self-organized by simple,\\ncost-effective processes (32).\\nNear the percolation threshold, tunneling across gaps between\\nparticles contributes to the conductivity of the network (see Fig. 1 and\\nfig. S1), and it is necessary to go beyond standard approaches to\\ncontinuum percolation that consider only ohmic connections between\\nwell-connected particles (28). Percolating-tunneling systems have,\\nhowever, received relatively little theoretical attention [see (31, 33)\\nand references therein), and quantities such as the relevant percolation\\ncritical exponents are yet to be calculated. Experimentally, it is ob-\\nserved that external electrical stimuli cause conductive filaments to\\nbe continually formed and broken within the tunnel gaps (Fig. 1A,\\ninsets) (29), leading to a complex and dynamical network comprising\\nconducting pathways, switches, and tunnel junctions (further\\nillustrated in fig. S2).\\nBehavior of critical networks\\nThe importance of criticality for neuromorphic computing was dis-\\ncussed in previous work on silver nanowire networks (13), but criti-\\ncality in self-organized nanodevices has never been investigated\\nsystematically. Here, we investigate criticality in percolating nanopar-\\nticle networks using analysis techniques similar to those previously\\nused on recordings of neuronal signals (24–27).\\nFigure 1 and fig. S2 show how avalanches are generated in the\\ndynamical percolating network. When an atomic switch is activated\\nin one tunnel gap, consequent changes in the electric field (and cur-\\nrent) in other tunnel gaps cause further events at other locations in\\nthe network (34). That is, each successive switching event leads to\\nothers, creating an avalanche. As illustrated in Fig. 1D and fig. S2, the\\nsurface coverage is important in controlling the network connectivity:\\nIf too many (or too few) events are triggered, then the avalanche will\\naccelerate uncontrollably (or die quickly)—critical dynamics are\\nFig. 2. Spatial and temporal self-similarity and correlation in switching activity. (A) Percolating devices produce complex patterns of switching events that are\\nself-similar in nature. The top panel contains 2400 s of data, with the bottom panels showing segments of the data with 10, 100, and 1000 times greater temporal\\nmagnification and with 3, 9, and 27 times greater magnification on the vertical scale (units of G0 = 2e2/h, the quantum of conductance, are used for convenience). The\\nactivity patterns appear qualitatively similar on multiple different time scales.

(C and F) IEIs follow power law distributions, suggestive of correlations between\\nevents. (D and G) Further evidence of temporal correlation between events is given by the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the switching activity (red), which decays\\nas a power law over several decades. When the IEI sequence is shuffled (gray), the correlations between events are destroyed, resulting in a significant increase in slope\\nin the ACF. The data shown in (B) to (D) (sample I) were obtained with our standard (slow) sampling rate, and the data shown in (E) to (G) (sample II) were measured\\n1000 times faster (see Materials and Methods), providing further evidence for self-similarity.\\nS C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E\\nMallinson et al., Sci.

While the propagation of avalanches is\\ncommonly described as a percolation phenomenon (17), avalanches\\nhave not previously been reported in percolating networks.\\nRESULTS\\nAvalanches of electrical signals and correlations\\nThe simple contact geometry (Fig. 1A) allows us to sensitively observe\\nelectrical signals from the entire network, and Fig. 2A shows complex\\npatterns of switching events [observed as discrete changes in the de-\\nvice conductance (G)], which are qualitatively similar to those observed\\ndue to neuronal avalanches in cortical tissue (24–27). Figure 2A high-\\nlights the self-similar nature of the avalanches, with characteristic bursts\\nof activity on multiple time scales. Quantitative analysis of the ava-\\nlanches is discussed below. Figure 2 (B and E) shows that the measured\\nchanges in conductance (DG) range over about three orders of magni-\\ntude, with different signalsizes reflecting the locations of the switches on\\ndifferent pathways through the highly branched network. The\\ndistribution of measured DG values is heavy tailed (Fig. 2, B and E),\\nconsistent with spatial self-similarity in percolating structures (35).\\nHistograms of interevent intervals (IEIs) (Fig. 2, C and F) show\\nclear power law behavior, implying scale-free dynamics. The cor-\\nresponding autocorrelation functions (ACFs) are shown in Fig. 2\\n(D and G). Again, power law behavior is observed. The data shown\\nin Fig. 2 (D and G) are obtained with sampling rates that are different\\nby a factor of a thousand, and yet the power law exponents (b) ob-\\ntained are almost identical (b ~0.2). Together, these data cover more\\nthan five orders of magnitude in time and provide strong evidence\\nfor temporal self-similarity (36). However, so-called renewal pro-\\ncesses, where successive IEIs are uncorrelated, can also exhibit power\\nlaw ACFs (37), and so we show in Fig. 2 (D and G) the ACFs obtained\\nwhen the sequence of IEIs is randomly shuffled to destroy any cor-\\nrelations. The experimental data have a much smaller slope than the\\nshuffled data, indicating long-range temporal correlations (36). We\\nnote that in the neuroscience literature, it is often difficult to directly\\nmeasure ACFs, and so detrended fluctuation analysis is commonly used\\nto quantify correlations [see (36, 38) and citations therein]. For compar-\\nison, we use the relationship b = 2 −2H (38) to estimate the Hurst\\nexponent (H). We find H ~0.9, consistent with the strong correlations\\ndescribed below. This is a first piece of evidence for highly correlated\\nactivity in our networks, but the more detailed analysis below is required\\nto unambiguously demonstrate avalanches and criticality.\\nDemonstration of criticality\\nIn critical systems, the sizes (S) and durations (T) of avalanches\\nhave probability density functions (PDFs) that follow well-defined\\npower law distributions\\nPðSÞeS–t\\nð1Þ\\nPðTÞeT–a\\nð2Þ\\nand the mean sizes of the avalanches are related to their durations by\\n〈S〉ðTÞ∼T1=snz\\nð3Þ\\nFig. 3.

The distributions shown in (A) to (E) (sample I, slow sampling rate) and (F) to (J) (sample\\nII, fast sampling rate) demonstrate the existence of self-similar avalanches across multiple time scales.

This shape collapse\\nyields an independent measure of the critical exponent 1/snz ≈1.6.

To demonstrate criticality\\n(i.e., to distinguish from other processes, such as random walks, that\\ncan also lead to power law distributed avalanches), these three\\nindependent estimates of 1/snz must be in agreement (23, 27, 39).\\nAvalanches in our percolating networks have sizes and durations\\n(see Materials and Methods) that are distributed in accordance with\\npower laws (Eqs. 1 and 2), as shown in Fig. 3 (A and F) and Fig. 3 (B\\nand G).

We empha-\\nsize that the important feature of Fig. 4 is that in almost every case, the\\nblue, cyan, and green symbols agree within the uncertainties. This is\\ntrue for a number of devices, for a range of stimuli, and for repeated\\nindependent measurements on the same devices. The fact that all three\\nestimates of 1/snz are in agreement is very strong evidence for criti-\\ncality in our percolating devices (39). The agreement of all estimates\\nof 1/snz even while a and t vary (Fig. 4) is evidence for self-tuned\\ncriticality (18).\\nDISCUSSION\\nThe avalanches of switching events observed here exhibit statistics that\\nare qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of the avalanches\\nobserved in cortical tissue (25, 41) and in very recent work on whole\\norganisms (26). Within the brain, criticality is hypothesized to play a\\nrole in cognition, adaptive behavior, and disease diagnosis and under-\\npins several therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities (19). Criticality\\nin our system originates from long-range spatiotemporal correlations\\nin the network of atomic switches, as required (18) for neuromorphic\\ncomputing strategies such as RC (10).\\nIn RC, spatiotemporal correlations are required to allow projection\\nof input signals into higher-dimensional spaces; corresponding output\\nsignals can then be combined using linear regression to perform com-\\nputational tasks such as classification, pattern recognition, and time\\nseries prediction (10–12). The need to build critical systems to provide\\na platform for RC has previously been highlighted in (17, 18). Our per-\\ncolating networks meet that need.\\nPrevious demonstrations of RC using nanoscale devices have relied\\non small numbers of device elements (11, 12) because integration\\ninto appropriate physical networks is challenging and/or expensive.\\nFig. 4. Demonstration of criticality. Estimates of three independent measures\\nof 1/snz are obtained from the crackling relationship (green), plots of mean ava-\\nlanche size given duration (blue), and avalanche shape collapse (cyan). The blue,\\ncyan, and green symbols agree within the measurement uncertainty in almost\\nevery case. Each panel also shows the power law exponents of avalanche size\\n(t; red) and avalanche duration (a; amber). (A) Critical exponents for sample I over\\na range of low voltages and for a combined dataset (low sampling rate; see\\nMaterials and Methods), showing that the critical exponents are substantially\\nindependent of voltage. (B) Comparison of critical exponents measured for sample\\nII for repeated, independent 6 V DC measurements (fast sampling rate; see Materials\\nand Methods). (C) Critical exponents for sample III as a function of voltage (slow\\nsampling rate). (D) Data from a second sequence of measurements on sample III\\nidentical to that in (C), showing that while the exponents a and t vary because\\nof internal reconfigurations of the percolating device, the three estimates of 1/snz\\nremain in good agreement at every voltage. (E and F) Voltage-dependent data from\\nsample IV (E and F, fast and slow sampling rates, respectively), showing that critical-\\nity and self-similarity are observed on vastly different time scales. The mean values\\nof 1/snz were found to be 1.46 ± 0.05, 1.40 ± 0.03, and 1.40 ± 0.04 from the crackling\\nrelationship, 〈S〉(T) and shape collapse, respectively (uncertainties are 1 SD), indicat-\\ning that there is no significant difference between the estimates from the three\\nindependent methods. This is confirmed by a single-factor analysis of variance\\n(ANOVA) test (P = 0.47). The (t, a) data are replotted in fig.

In contrast, the straightforward\\ndeposition methods used here immediately provide the required\\ncomplex network of switches, are inexpensive, and allow electronic\\nreadout of correlated signals from the network as required for integra-\\ntion with other electronic components. We believe our processes are\\nscalable because they are compatible with standard complementary\\nmetal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processing.\\nOur percolating networks are naturally suited to RC since deposi-\\ntion onto multielectrode arrays will straightforwardly provide the\\nrequired multiple inputs and outputs. Ultimately, we envisage ar-\\nchitectures in which the percolating network is deposited onto chips\\nwith predefined CMOS circuitry that processes input and output\\nsignals. The question of how best to code input/output signals for par-\\nticular computational tasks has so far been given little consideration in\\nthe RC literature and will require further investigation since combina-\\ntions of temporal and spatial input/output coding are possible (12).\\nWe believe that percolating devices could provide many further op-\\nportunities for brain-like computing; for example, three-dimensional\\npercolating systems could provide additional network complexity.\\nWhile our attempts to tune the operating point of the system by vary-\\ning the surface coverage were unsuccessful (see Materials and Methods),\\nit may yet be possible to tune the system through the critical point using\\nother external control parameters. In addition, strategies can be envis-\\naged that would incorporate a wide range of alternative switching\\nelements within the networks, such as phase-change materials, oxide-\\nbased memristors, and electrochemical switches (6–9). Last, we\\nhighlight the need for theoretical work/simulations to support device\\ndevelopment. Percolating-tunneling networks have so far been rela-\\ntively little studied (31, 33), and important quantities such as the degree\\ndistribution for network connections (21), percolation critical expo-\\nnents (28), and precise universality class (23) are yet to be elucidated.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nDevice fabrication\\nOur percolating devices were fabricated by simple nanoparticle\\ndeposition processes (32, 44). Seven-nanometer Sn nanoparticles were\\ndeposited between gold electrodes (spacing, 100 mm) on a silicon ni-\\ntride surface. Deposition was terminated at the onset of conduction,\\nwhich corresponds to the percolation threshold (28, 44). The deposi-\\ntion takes place in a controlled environment with a well-defined par-\\ntial pressure of air and humidity, as described in (32). This process\\nleads to controlled coalescence and fabrication of robust structures,\\nwhich function for many months but which yet allow atomic-scale\\nswitching processes to take place unhindered. The individual atomic-\\nscalefilamentsformedwithintunnelinggapsexhibitquantizedconduction\\n(29), but, as shown in fig. S1 (E and F), the complex percolating-\\ntunneling network comprises many parallel and series paths, and so\\nthe device conductance is not quantized.\\nAs described in the discussion of Fig. 4, data from all devices\\npresented here are consistent with criticality. To explore noncritical\\nnetworks, several devices were fabricated with surface coverages that\\nwere either below or above the percolation threshold (see Fig. 1, B and\\nD). In all cases, however, it was not possible to observe avalanches of\\nevents. When stimulated, low-coverage devices exhibit a number of ir-\\nreversible drops in conductance and rapidly become open circuit:\\nAtomic switches can be opened, but the prevalence of large gaps in\\nthe network makes closing switches difficult. High-coverage devices ex-\\nhibit no switching events for small stimulus voltages and exhibit ir-\\nreversible drops in conductance for larger stimulus voltages due to\\nmelting of particles when large currents flow.\\nElectrical stimulus and measurement\\nElectrical stimuli were applied to the contact on one side of the\\npercolating device, while the opposite edge of the system was held at\\nground potential. While a variety of types of stimuli (voltage pulses\\nand ramps) can be applied to the system, constant DC voltages were\\nused in this work because they facilitate observation of ongoing recon-\\nfigurations of the states of the switches in the devices and, in particular,\\nthe analysis of avalanches (see below). Measurements over long time\\nperiods are also necessary to avoid significant cutoffs in the power law\\ndistributions (17). Here, we presented data from DC stimulus of four\\ndevices, but the data presented are consistent with that obtained from\\nDC, pulsed, and ramped voltage stimulus of a further 10 devices.\\nOur electrical measurements were performed using two distinct\\nsets of measurement electronics to allow measurement of the device\\nconductance on two distinct time scales. The first method relies on a\\npicoammeter and is limited to a relatively slow sampling rate (0.1 s\\nsampling interval). The second method uses a fast digital oscilloscope\\nto allow a much higher sampling rate (200 ms sampling interval for the\\ndata presented here). As shown in Figs. 2 to 4, both methods resulted\\nin qualitatively and quantitatively similar data, with similar power law\\nexponents for each of the main quantities of interest. Hence, our\\nresults and conclusions are not influenced by the sampling rate.\\nData analysis\\nThe data analysis methods used in this work are substantially the\\nsame as those developed in the neuroscience community to analyze\\nmicroelectrode array recordings from biological brain tissue (24–27).\\nEvents are defined as changes in the conductance signal that exceed a\\nthreshold value. We show in fig. S3 that, as in the neuroscience liter-\\nature, the choice of threshold in a reasonable range does not signifi-\\ncantly affect the avalanche analysis. Avalanches were defined following\\nthe procedure described in (24, 45): The data were analyzed by defining\\ntime bins with width equal to the mean IEI (24), and the duration of\\nthe avalanche was defined as the number of consecutive nonempty\\nbins between empty bins. Figure S4 shows the effect of bin size on\\nthe avalanche analysis.\\nPower law exponents and “fitting” processes\\nWe followed the maximum likelihood (ML) approach of (46), as im-\\nplemented in the Neural Complexity and Criticality MATLAB tool-\\nbox by (45), to statistically validate criticality. For all data that can be\\nplotted in the form of a PDF (IEIs, S, and T), the ML estimators were\\nobtained for both power law and exponential distributions. We used\\nthe Bayesian information criterion (47) to identify which distribution\\nis more likely and find in all cases that it is the power law (46), as\\nshown in fig. S5.\\nWe generated 500 random power laws using the calculated ML\\nestimators and iterated the choice of cutoffs (xmin and xmax) for the data\\nrange, finding the probability of obtaining a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)\\ndistance (46) at least as great as for that of experimental data. In all cases,\\nwe failed to reject the null hypothesis that avalanche distributions are\\npower law distributed (we required P > 0.2). Conversely, we rejected the\\nnull hypothesis that avalanche distributions are power law distributed\\nfor shuffled data (see Fig. 3, A, B, F, and G) (41), i.e., when we removed\\nthe correlations in the experimental avalanche data, we found that the\\nS C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E\\nMallinson et al., Sci.

The deviation from power\\nlaw behavior in our data is rather small (see Figs. 2 and 3), but we\\nnevertheless followed (45, 46) and allowed the data to be truncated to\\nshow definitively that the distributions are power law. The IEI dis-\\ntributions were found to be power law over about two orders of mag-\\nnitude in time, with both a lower and upper cutoff. The avalanche\\nsize and duration distributions are always found to be power law up\\nto the maximum range of the data, i.e., the data are power law over at\\nleast three orders of magnitude for the sizes and two for the durations.\\nIn all plots shown here, the range in which the power law model is in\\nagreement with the data is indicated by the solid line. The estimated\\nuncertainties in a and t are ±0.1. Uncertainties estimated from the ML\\nprocedure are smaller but do not reflect the scatter in the data.\\nThe ML methods cannot be applied to data which is not in the\\nform of a probability distribution, and so, as in (23, 25, 45), stan-\\ndard linear regression techniques were used to obtain the measured\\nexponents for 〈S〉(T) and A(t).\\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS\\nSupplementary material for this article is available at http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/\\ncontent/full/5/11/eaaw8438/DC1\\nFig. S1.

Brown*\\nCurrent efforts to achieve neuromorphic computation are focused on highly organized architectures, such as\\nintegrated circuits and regular arrays of memristors, which lack the complex interconnectivity of the brain and\\nso are unable to exhibit brain-like dynamics. New architectures are required, both to emulate the complexity of\\nthe brain and to achieve critical dynamics and consequent maximal computational performance. We show here\\nthat electrical signals from self-organized networks of nanoparticles exhibit brain-like spatiotemporal correla-\\ntions and criticality when fabricated at a percolating phase transition. Specifically, the sizes and durations of\\navalanches of switching events are power law distributed, and the power law exponents satisfy rigorous criteria\\nfor criticality.

Neuromorphic processing\\nhas been implemented in a number of hardware platforms, using\\ncomponents ranging from traditional silicon-based technology (1, 2),\\ncrossbar memristor arrays (3–6), and novel nanoscale device elements\\nthat use atomic-scale dynamics to mimic the behavior of synapses and\\nneurons (7–9). All of these approaches rely on highly ordered architec-\\ntures, but neuromorphic computational paradigms such as reservoir\\ncomputing (RC) (10–12) require complex networks with strong in-\\nherent spatiotemporal correlations (13, 14). Maximal computational\\nperformance (15–17) in these systems requires network architec-\\ntures that are not only complex but also critical (18).\\nAt a critical point (17–20), the underlying network is scale free\\n(21, 22), and the dynamics are characterized by scale-invariant ava-\\nlanches, as observed in many systems ranging from earthquakes to\\nbiological extinctions and magnetization dynamics (23).

       "'Query: What are the main findings of this paper?\\n\\nContext: Measurements over long time\\nperiods are also necessary to avoid significant cutoffs in the power law\\ndistributions (17). Here, we presented data from DC stimulus of four\\ndevices, but the data presented are consistent with that obtained from\\nDC, pulsed, and ramped voltage stimulus of a further 10 devices.\\nOur electrical measurements were performed using two distinct\\nsets of measurement electronics to allow measurement of the device\\nconductance on two distinct time scales. The first method relies on a\\npicoammeter and is limited to a relatively slow sampling rate (0.1 s\\nsampling interval). The second method uses a fast digital oscilloscope\\nto allow a much higher sampling rate (200 ms sampling interval for the\\ndata presented here). As shown in Figs. 2 to 4, both methods resulted\\nin qualitatively and quantitatively similar data, with similar power law\\nexponents for each of the main quantities of interest. Hence, our\\nresults and conclusions are not influenced by the sampling rate.\\nData analysis\\nThe data analysis methods used in this work are substantially the\\nsame as those developed in the neuroscience community to analyze\\nmicroelectrode array recordings from biological brain tissue (24–27).\\nEvents are defined as changes in the conductance signal that exceed a\\nthreshold value. We show in fig. S3 that, as in the neuroscience liter-\\nature, the choice of threshold in a reasonable range does not signifi-\\ncantly affect the avalanche analysis. Avalanches were defined following\\nthe procedure described in (24, 45): The data were analyzed by defining\\ntime bins with width equal to the mean IEI (24), and the duration of\\nthe avalanche was defined as the number of consecutive nonempty\\nbins between empty bins. Figure S4 shows the effect of bin size on\\nthe avalanche analysis.\\nPower law exponents and “fitting” processes\\nWe followed the maximum likelihood (ML) approach of (46), as im-\\nplemented in the Neural Complexity and Criticality MATLAB tool-\\nbox by (45), to statistically validate criticality. For all data that can be\\nplotted in the form of a PDF (IEIs, S, and T), the ML estimators were\\nobtained for both power law and exponential distributions. We used\\nthe Bayesian information criterion (47) to identify which distribution\\nis more likely and find in all cases that it is the power law (46), as\\nshown in fig. S5.\\nWe generated 500 random power laws using the calculated ML\\nestimators and iterated the choice of cutoffs (xmin and xmax) for the data\\nrange, finding the probability of obtaining a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)\\ndistance (46) at least as great as for that of experimental data.
