# The Workshop

This material is designed to help you get started with using large language models. It is designed to be a hands-on workshop, where you will be guided through the process of setting up a new project, and then building a simple LLM application.

Although the material is designed to be followed in order, you can jump to any section you like. We usually run this event over a day, with a mix of talks and practical sessions.
