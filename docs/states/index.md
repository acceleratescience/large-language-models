# States and Data Storage

In this section we cover two main areas:

1. Managing system states - LLMs are inherently stateless, so we need a way to keep track of the information we give to and get out of them.
2. Databases - an introduction to ChromaDB and how to build a database.

We will cover how to keep track of information like conversation history and token usage. We then use LLMs to generate a running summary of a conversaton for us. Finally, we introduce databases, and explore how we can build and search them.
