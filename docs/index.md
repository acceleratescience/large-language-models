# LLM Hands on Workshop

Welcome to the material for the LLM Hands on Workshop!

This page is pretty simple, start with [Setting up](1_setting_up.md) and then continue through the sections in order. We start with some basic API calls, then introduce more features until we have a fully working chat application.

The main outcome of this workshop is to have you conversing with an LLM about your own research or data.

Or you can just pick a section that interests you.
