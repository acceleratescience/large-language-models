Welcome to the Introduction to Large Language Models workshop offered by the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. In this workshop, we will get situated in the chaotic and fast-moving world of LLMs!

This workshop was originally delivered in-person at the University of Cambridge, but we have made the slides and some of the material available here for you to work through at your own pace.
