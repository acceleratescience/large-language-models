      "- **N = 3**: With 3 lions, if one lion eats the sheep, it becomes a sheep and the other two lions can then eat it. Each lion knows that if it eats the sheep, it risks being eaten by one of the other two lions. Thus, all three lions will refrain from eating the sheep. The sheep is safe.\n",

      "- **N = 5**: With 5 lions, if one lion eats the sheep, it becomes a sheep and the other four lions can eat it. The lion that eats the sheep knows it will be outnumbered by the remaining four lions, so it will not eat the sheep.
